                <h2>What is a Computer Virus ?</h2>
                <img id="virus"src="img/virus.jpg" alt="Virus" />
                <p>A <b>computer virus</b> is a small computer-to-computer software that disrupts the operation of a machine. A computer virus can damage or delete data from the computer, use an e-mail program to 
                transmit to other computers, or erase any item stored on the hard disk.</br></br>


                Computer viruses spread frequently via email attachments or instant messages. This is why you should never open an attachment without knowing the sender of the e-mail message or if you did 
                not expect it to be received. Viruses can appear as attachments in the form of humorous images, greeting cards, audio or video files. They also spread via Internet downloads. They may be 
                hidden in pirated software or other files or programs available for download.</p>

                <h2>What is a worm ?</h2>
                <img id="worm" src="img/worm.jpeg" alt="worm" />
                <p>A <b>worm</b> is a computer code that spreads without user intervention. Most worms are in attachments that infect a computer as soon as they are opened. The worm scans the infected computer 
                for files, such as address books or temporary web pages, that contain e-mail addresses. The worm uses addresses to send infected e-mail messages and frequently replicates (or impersonates) 
                sender addresses in recent messages so that infected messages appear to come from someone you know. Worms then propagate automatically via e-mail messages, networks, or operating system 
                vulnerabilities, often overwriting these systems before the cause is known. Worms are not always harmful to computers, but they usually cause performance and stability problems on the 
                network and the computer.</p>

                <h2>Terminology</h2>
                <p>Its name comes from an analogy with the biological virus because it has similarities in the way it spreads using the reproductive powers of the host cell. The term "computer virus" is 
                attributed to computer scientist and molecular biologist Leonard Adleman.</br></br>

                Computer viruses should not be confused with computer worms, which are programs that can propagate and duplicate on their own without contaminating host programs. In the broadest sense, the 
                word virus is often used and misused to refer to any form of malicious software.</p>
