                <h2>Make sure to protect yourself !</h2>
                <p>Knowing the threats and taking appropriate action will reduce the risk of your computer or device getting infected. One of the best ways to protect yourself from viruses is to install 
                comprehensive Internet security software on all your devices, and keep it up to date. Make sure the firewall on your computer is turned on and do regular scans. Otherwise :</p>

                    <li class="list">Be aware that free music and video file sharing programs may include unwanted software that compromises your privacy and security.</li>
                    <li class="list">Keep your operating system up-to-date.</li>
                    <li class="list">Read application reviews and check the permissions that applications require. Always download apps from official app stores.</li>
                    <li class="list">Beware of false alerts about viruses.</li>
                    <li class="list">Use the Internet carefully. Do not open unwanted mail or attachments and do not click on suspicious links. Instead, use bookmarks or type the web address directly into your browser.</li>
                    <li class="list">Always read the privacy policies of user license agreements before downloading any software.</li>
                    <li class="list">Do not 'jailbreakez' your device.</li>
                    <li class="list">For your daily activities, use a user account. Only use an administrator account when you really need it.</li>
                    <li class="list">Adjust the security settings of your web browser.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Remember to make regular backups so you can recover your data when needed.</p>

                <img id="detected" src="img/virus_detected.jpg" alt="detected" /> 
                <p>Do an analysis. Your Internet security software may be able to identify and manage intrusions that would have escaped its defenses. Follow the instructions of the program to handle the 
                threat.</br></br>

                To work towards solving the problem, avoid using your infected computer.</br></br>

                Only attempt to delete a virus manually if you know the subject and have previously saved all your important data. When in doubt, consult a professional.</br></br>

                If you think the infection may be serious, turn off Wi-Fi or unplug your computer. This will stop the spread of the virus to other devices on your network, and prevent it from sending or 
                receiving information. Then make an appointment with a professional.</p>

                <h2>Do not let your guard down !</h2>
                <p>Malware can be a major source of irritation and disruption. More seriously, they can corrupt or delete files, and steal your confidential data. And if a virus is not stopped, it can 
                reproduce and spread, causing damage to other people.</br></br>

                The best way to manage viruses is to avoid them. Now that you know what they are and how they work, you can take the appropriate steps to block access</p>
