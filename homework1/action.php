                <p>Viruses are usually embedded in executable files. Even if they are present on your system, they are not activated and can only be transmitted when you open a program or a host file.</br></br>

                Viruses can look like an image, an attachment, video or audio files that you download, or be contracted when you visit a compromised website. Some viruses can take advantage of system 
                vulnerabilities. The most common types of infection are downloading a file over the Internet or clicking on attachments</p>

                <h2>How do they invade you ?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">When the file or software on which they are grafted is sent from one infected computer to another on the same network;</li>
                    <li class="list">Through an email message or a compromised attachment;</li>
                    <li class="list">Through a shared file, an infected disk or USB stick.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Which devices do they attack ?</h2>
                <p>Viruses mainly target computers. Computer programs can be offered online without any prior review, with a significant risk of infection by a virus. That's why it's mainly computers that 
                are targeted.</br></br>

                However, other devices like tablets and smartphones are also vulnerable. There are fewer viruses targeting phones and tablets because applications are examined before being included in 
                directories like Google Play or the Apple App Store.</br></br>

                In addition, applications are usually isolated from the operating system and can not access the entire device. If you root or jailbreak your device, you make it more vulnerable to malware.</br></br>

                Android, being open source and widely used, is the first target of mobile malware. iOS is less vulnerable because it is a closed system and because Apple has lower market shares. However, iOS is not immune to attacks, and both platforms are also vulnerable to social engineering.</p>
